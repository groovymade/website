            Hi, we're Groovy Made, a <mark>corporate umbrella</mark> for independent builders
            that want to turn good ideas into real revenue.
        </p>

        <div class="lead-box">
            <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
            <p>We take care of contracts, payments, admin, and taxes â€“ so you can stay focused on building and getting paid, instead of on corporate drama.</p>
        </div>



        <p>Thanks for dropping by ðŸ‘‹</p>

        <p>If youâ€™ve ever built a product, you know the feeling:</p>

        <p>Youâ€™ve got the idea, the code, the IP â€“ but then come the contracts, taxes, payments, refunds, and admin spread across three countries.<br><br>
        The stuff nobody talks about when youâ€™re dreaming up your next big thing.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve lived that too.</p>

        <p>So we built <strong>Groovy Made</strong> â€“ the back office for smart founders.</p>

        <p>We handle everything behind the scenes so you can focus on what you do best: building and shipping.</p>

        <p>No equity drama.<br><br>
        No corporate clutter.<br><br>
        No messy spreadsheets.  </p>

        <p>Just clean, fair royalty payouts â€“ and optional help with the extras when you need it.</p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Draft clear, royalty-based partnership agreements<br></li>
        <li>Register your project under our corporate umbrella<br></li>
        <li>Optionally act as Merchant of Record for digital sales<br></li>
        <li>Handle payments, refunds, taxes, and compliance<br></li>
        <li>Maintain separate P&amp;L tracking for each project<br></li>
        <li>Pay creators quarterly â€“ up to 80% of net receipts<br></li>
        <li>Offer optional add-ons like launch help, branding, or light advisory<br></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Who itâ€™s for</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Indie founders, solo builders, and tiny teams<br></li>
        <li>One-person plugins, AI experiments, small SaaS products<br></li>
        <li>Anyone who wants to launch and get paid â€“ without the overhead<br></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Bring your idea</strong> â€“ if itâ€™s real IP, weâ€™ll help you wrap it properly<br></li>
        <li><strong>We run the back office</strong> â€“ contracts, billing, admin, and taxes<br></li>
        <li><strong>You get paid</strong> â€“ quarterly royalties with clear statements and clean separation between projects<br></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Every project operates as its own royalty-bearing entity.<br><br>
        We manage the boring stuff â€“ you keep control of your product and profits.  </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why royalties?</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you donâ€™t need cofounders.<br><br>
        Sometimes you donâ€™t want to split your equity pie.<br><br>
        Sometimes you just want a clean way to launch, share revenue, and stay independent.  </p>

        <p><strong>Royalties keep it simple.</strong><br><br>
        No dilution.<br>No legal tangles.<br>Just fair splits for real work.  </p>

        <p>Our framework is based on transparent, open royalty agreements â€“ simple, fair, and flexible.  </p>
